===========================================
Plot Benchling DNA Sequences as SBOL Visual
===========================================

This python package uses the [Benchling API Client](https://github.com/castillohair/Benchling-API-Client) to read a DNA sequence from benchling, and [dnaplotlib](https://github.com/VoigtLab/dnaplotlib) to instantly plot that sequence as an [SBOL Visual](http://sbolstandard.org/visual/) diagram.

Installation
============

Make sure to install [dnaplotlib](https://github.com/VoigtLab/dnaplotlib) and the [Benchling API Client](https://github.com/castillohair/Benchling-API-Client) first.

Clone or download this package, and run the following from a terminal:

.. code::

    python setup.py install

Usage
=====

First, you will need to request an API key from Benchling. You can do that either via email or using the chat function in the Benchling UI.

Check the `examples` folder for more information.
