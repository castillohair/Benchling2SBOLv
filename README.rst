This python package uses the `Benchling API Client`_ to read a DNA sequence from benchling, and dnaplotlib_ to instantly plot that sequence as an `SBOL Visual`_ diagram.

Installation
============

Make sure to install dnaplotlib_ and the `Benchling API Client`_ first.

Clone or download this package, and run the following from a terminal:

.. code::

    python setup.py install

Usage
=====

First, you will need to request an API key from Benchling. You can do that either via email or using the chat function in the Benchling UI.

Check the `examples` folder for more information.
